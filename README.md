# docsearch

Organize your PDFs and scanned paperware as a web app (optionally docker)

This is an alternative to [Paperless](https://github.com/danielquinn/paperless), [Ambar](https://ambar.cloud/) and several others.

Advantages of this approach is:
  - Small footprint
  - Fast and lean webapp
  
  
Future progress may include:
  - Built-in FTP server for transfer from scanner to docsearch
  - HTTPS
  - User seperation
